# Ecommerce-Sales-Analysis-Using-Excel
1. In this project of Microsoft Excel, I have taken a Ecommerce Sales Dataset which is consist of columns like: OrderID, Order Date, CustomerID, Customer Name and other purchasing details.
2. The Microsoft Excel workbook which is containing: Data, Pivot Tables, Charts used for dashboard, and the main Dashboard is available here: https://1drv.ms/x/s!An3836FAvJetgv4oPQSOysWPtBtQAg?e=xgt2MW
3. So in this project, First of all, I have extracted the desired data using pivot tables and then turned those pivots into desired charts and used them into making a dashboard.
4. In dashboard, I have taken these charts for particular type of columns in this way:
   
      --> I have made 5 Scordcards of different simple and calculated attributes such as Sales, Profit, Quantity, Count of Orders, and Profit Margin, also I have created Line Charts of these values varying with Month column. I have also mentioned their YearONYear (YOY) Growth percentage with specific colors such as "GREEN" for Increaese and "RED" for decrease.
   
      --> I have taken one double axis chart for 'Sales' and 'Profit' Analysis where Area chart represents 'Profit' and Bar Chart represents 'Sales' by Month.
   
      --> After that I have shown Category wise Profit using a 'Water Fall' Chart with Grand Total.

      --> Category Wise Sales percentage using Donut Shape chart (kind of Pie Chart).

      --> Top 15 States by Sales using a Simple Bar Chart.

      --> Top 5 Sub-Categories by Sales using Horizontal Bar Chart.

      --> In last, at bottom-right corner, filters have been given wrt to "Year", "Segment", and "Region".

   5. So, in this way, we have seen the step-by-step explanation about the whole dashboard making.
